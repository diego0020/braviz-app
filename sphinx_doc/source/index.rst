Braviz is both, a python library, and a system with graphical user interface which
can be used to analyze brain data. To start select the point of view from which
you want to use Braviz below.

About
-------

Braviz is being developed at the `imagine <imagine.uniandes.edu.co>`_ research group
as part of a phd thesis. The objective is providing brain researchers with interactive
visualization tools, which will allow them to explore and grab insights from
large and heterogeneus data-sets more efficiently. The focus is on user centered design,
for heavy processing, calculations and visualization we rely when ever possible in
other libraries.
