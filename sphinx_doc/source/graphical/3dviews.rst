Navigating 3d views
====================

Braviz uses `vtk <http://www.vtk.org>`_ for displaying 3d data. In particular we use an interaction style called
`trackball camera <http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkInteractorStyleTrackballCamera.html#details>`.
The mouse is used to control the camera which moves on a sphere around the view.

To rotate the camera to the left or to the right, or to the top or the bottom; click and hold the left mouse button, outside from any object, and
drag it.

To spin the camera around its own axis, press ``ctrl`` while dragging the mouse. Remember that you must start the action
away from any image or surface.
