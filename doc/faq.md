## Subject Overview

#### Where do I start?
>This application can show you several types of data from a single subject.
>In the buttom frame you find some information about the current subj and the left panel provide controls over what you are seeing in the main view. The different tabs in the left panel allow you to control diferent kinds of data. There are tabs for controlling
>
> * Images
> * Segmented Structures
> * Tractography
> * Cortex parcelations
>
>Additionally there are two tabs that give additional tabular information of the subject. The arrows under the main view can be used to cycle through subjects.
>Finally the panel at the bottom left allows you to reset the camera to standard views, and to change the coordinate system.


#### How do I navigate the *3D* View?

> When you click over an image or a cortical surface, you will be able to query information about them. In order to move the camera it is necessary to click *outside* from any of these. 
> * To rotate the view, click, hold and move. Release the button to stop.
> * To rotate about an axis perpendicular to the screen, hold *control*, click, hold and move, as above.
> * To pan the view, middle-click hold and move. Release the button to stop. Alternatively use left click while holding shift.
> * To zoom the view right-click hold and move up or down. Release the button to stop. Alternatively you can use the mouse wheel.
> If you want to reset the camera look at the next question.

#### How do I reset the camera?

> In the bottom-left you will find a box labeled "camera to:", which will allow you to reset the camera to some useful predefined positions.

#### How do I change subject?

> Use the arrows under the main view. Alternatively, go to the subjects tab of the left panel and double click a subject in the list.

#### How do I change the current *coordinate* system ?

> In the bottom-left you will find a box labeled "Coordinates", which will allow you to choose a coordinate system for the viewer.

#### What *coordinate* systems are available?

> Currently there are three coordinate systems available:
> * World: This correspond to real world coordinates in *mm*. 
> * Talairach: Individuals are mapped to a talairach standard brain using an affine transform. This means that all objects are rotated and scaled in order to match the template. Relative distances are preserved.
> * Dartel: A non linear transformation is applied to map subjects to a Dartel template. Here each area of the brain is distorted in a different way, resulting in a very close match, but significant overall distortion. This is useful for comparing values at approximately similar locations across different subjects.

### Images

Most image manipulation tasks are carried out using the image tab of the left frame.

#### How do I change the Image *slice*

> Use the slice box or the slider in the Image tab. Alternatively hold the middle mouse button over the image and move the mouse.

#### How do I change the current Image?

> Use the modality box in the Image tab.

#### How do I *hide* the Image?

> Select None in the modality box of the image tab.

#### How do I change the *orientation* of the Image ?

> Use the Orientation box in the image tab. Notice the camera will not move when changing the orientation, so you will probably have to move it in order to get a good view of the new image.

### Segmented Structures

#### How do I display structures?

#### How do I change the *color* of the structures?

#### How can I display areas of the *dominant* cortex?

#### How can I *calculate* metrics from the structures?

### Tractography

#### How can I see the *full* tractography?

#### How can I *filter* the current fibers?

#### How can I change the *color* of the current fibers ?

#### How can I view multiple *bundles* ?

#### How can I *calculate* metrics of the current fibers?

### Context Panel

#### How can I change the displayed variables?

#### How can I define a new variable?
