#Braviz Frequenty Asked Questions

## Subject Overview

#### Where do I start?
>This application can show you several types of data from a single subject.
>In the buttom frame you find some information about the current subj and the left panel provide controls over what you are seeing in the main view. The different tabs in the left panel allow you to control diferent kinds of data. There are tabs for controlling
>
> * Images
> * Segmented Structures
> * Tractography
> * Cortex parcelations
>
>Additionally there are two tabs that give additional tabular information of the subject. The arrows under the main view can be used to cycle through subjects.
>Finally the panel at the bottom left allows you to reset the camera to standard views, and to change the coordinate system.


#### How do I navigate the *3D* View?

> When you click over an image or a cortical surface, you will be able to query information about them. In order to move the camera it is necessary to click *outside* from any of these. 
> * To rotate the view, click, hold and move. Release the button to stop.
> * To rotate about an axis perpendicular to the screen, hold *control*, click, hold and move, as above.
> * To pan the view, middle-click hold and move. Release the button to stop. Alternatively use left click while holding shift.
> * To zoom the view right-click hold and move up or down. Release the button to stop. Alternatively you can use the mouse wheel.
> If you want to reset the camera look at the next question.
