<h2 id="subject-overview">Subject Overview</h2>
<h4 id="where-do-i-start">Where do I start?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This application can show you several types of data from a single subject. In the buttom frame you find some information about the current subj and the left panel provide controls over what you are seeing in the main view. The different tabs in the left panel allow you to control diferent kinds of data. There are tabs for controlling</p>
<ul>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Segmented Structures</li>
<li>Tractography</li>
<li>Cortex parcelations</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally there are two tabs that give additional tabular information of the subject. The arrows under the main view can be used to cycle through subjects. Finally the panel at the bottom left allows you to reset the camera to standard views, and to change the coordinate system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-do-i-navigate-the-3d-view">How do I navigate the <em>3D</em> View?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When you click over an image or a cortical surface, you will be able to query information about them. In order to move the camera it is necessary to click <em>outside</em> from any of these. * To rotate the view, click, hold and move. Release the button to stop. * To rotate about an axis perpendicular to the screen, hold <em>control</em>, click, hold and move, as above. * To pan the view, middle-click hold and move. Release the button to stop. Alternatively use left click while holding shift. * To zoom the view right-click hold and move up or down. Release the button to stop. Alternatively you can use the mouse wheel. If you want to reset the camera look at the next question.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-do-i-reset-the-camera">How do I reset the camera?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In the bottom-left you will find a box labeled &quot;camera to:&quot;, which will allow you to reset the camera to some useful predefined positions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-do-i-change-subject">How do I change subject?</h4>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-do-i-change-the-current-coordinate-system">How do I change the current <em>coordinate</em> system ?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In the bottom-left you will find a box labeled &quot;Coordinates&quot;, which will allow you to choose a coordinate system for the viewer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="coordinates">What <em>coordinate</em> systems are available?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently there are three coordinate systems available: * World: This correspond to real world coordinates in <em>mm</em>. * Talairach: Individuals are mapped to a talairach standard brain using an affine transform. This means that all objects are rotated and scaled in order to match the template. Relative distances are preserved. * Dartel: A non linear transformation is applied to map subjects to a Dartel template. Here each area of the brain is distorted in a different way, resulting in a very close match, but significant overall distortion. This is useful for comparing values at approximately similar locations across different subjects.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="how-do-i-perform-an-anova-analysis">How do I perform an Anova analysis?</h4>
<h4 id="what-is-an-outcome-variable-dependent-variable">What is an <em>outcome</em> variable (Dependent variable)?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the variable that is affected by a change in the other variables. Also called response, dependent variable or <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>. This could also be a variable we are interested in predict based on the other variables (regressors).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-do-i-add-regressors-or-independent-variables">How do I add regressors or independent variables?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>To add independent variables click on the &quot;add regressor&quot; button. A dialog where you can select variables will be shown. Select a variable by double clicking on its name, review the meta data information at the middle of the dialog, and afterwards click on &quot;save and add&quot; in the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-do-i-add-interactions">How do I add interactions?</h4>
<blockquote>

<p>Right click on its name in the regressors list, and select remove.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-the-residuals-plot">What is the <em>residuals</em> plot ?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The residuals plot show the distribution of the residuals after fitting the model. If the Anova's pre conditions are met, these residuals should be distributed in a normal distribution, and they should be independent from the outcome variable. If you notice that the residuals histogram is skewed or that the variance changes with the outcome variable, you should rethink your model. Maybe you are missing a variable, or maybe variables should be transformed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="what-type-of-sum-of-squares-is-being-used-for-the-calculation">What type of sum of squares is being used for the calculation?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We are using a type 3 sum of squares, as defined in the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/">car</a> anova function. We chose this type of sum because that is the default in many of the statistical software used in the domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="linear-regression">Linear Regression</h2>
<h4 id="are-variables-in-the-linear-model-centered">Are variables in the linear model centered?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, all rational variables are standardized by substracting the mean and dividing by 2 standard deviations. All nominal variables with two levels are standardized in such a way that the mean is zero, and the standard deviation is 1. Nominal variables with more than two levels are left as they are. The outcome variable is also standardized. All of this is accomplished using the &quot;Standardize&quot; function in the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arm/index.html">ARM</a> package.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="what-is-the-coefficients-plot">What is the <em>coefficients</em> plot?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The coefficients plot gives a quick indication of which coefficients are important for the model. The thick line corresponds to 1 standard deviation, and the thin line to the 95% confidence interval. If any of these lines cross the zero line, then that coefficient is not significantly different from zero. Also, the further away the coefficients are from the zero, the largest the effect size.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h2>
<h4 id="what-are-scenarios">What are scenarios?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Scenarios inside braviz correspond to states of the different tools. These include the selected variables, cameras for 3d views, selected structures in views, etc. The idea is to keep track of your exploration, to enable you to go back to a previous state, and to re visit interesting visializations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="subsamples">Subsamples</h2>
<h4 id="what-are-samples">What are samples?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Samples allow you to run all kinds of analyses in a subset of the population. You may define for example a sample for only female participants and run specific tests in this smaller population. Most of the tools in the braviz toolkit have an option to select a subsample.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-do-i-define-a-new-subsample">How do I define a new subsample?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When clicking in &quot;new&quot; in the subsamples dialog a dialog will appear. The left panel provides a working space, and the right panel provides a view of the current sample. In the middle there are buttons which allow you to move data between the two panels. You may hover the mouse over them to get a better idea of what they do. You may also right click in a single subject in the left panel to show a context menu with the option of adding him manually to the sample. In the same way you can right click in individual subjects in the right panel in order to remove them from the sample (for example outliers or erroneus data).</p>
